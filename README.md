# StockMarketScraper-Extracting-Real-Time-Stock-Data-from-Yahoo-Finance
In the scraping project, I have set my sights on the ever-dynamic world of stock markets, specifically targeting the prestigious Yahoo Finance website. With an aim to gather valuable insights, I am focusing on three intriguing categories: Top Gainer, Top Loser, and Most Active stocks. 
Within each category, I am gathering important details for each stock, including the Symbol and Name, the Price and Price Change, the Volume, as well as the Market Caps.
